# SkillAPI-s
This fork adds back support to the now unmantained SkillAPI plugin. I'm mostly doing it for personal use, so can't guarantee to do requested changes. But if they're not too time consuming I might :)
If you want to report a bug or make a suggestion, feel free to create an issue on here. 

* Compiled using IntellIJ IDEA and Maven

## New dynamic editor
If you use this version, I strongly recommend using the mantained Dynamic editor.
Skills made with the old editor should still mantain full functionality, but the new one has new stuff.

## Donations
I accept donations via PayPal, which I'll be using for the development of my MMORPG Minecraft server: Craftec
